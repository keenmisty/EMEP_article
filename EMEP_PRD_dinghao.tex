% \begin{EMEP/MSC-W模型简介}
EMEP(European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme)隶属于远距离跨界空气污染公约Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP)，旨在解决跨界空气污染问题。该公约旗下包含5个EMEP中心，其中一个为坐落于挪威奥斯陆的MSC-W，该中心主要负责光化学氧化剂和气溶胶的模拟。
EMEP/MSC-W模型是由挪威气象局开发的化学传输模型（自1977年至今），最初EMEP/MSC-W模型以50KM*50KM的分辨率覆盖整个欧洲，垂直方向上可从地面延伸到
对流层顶（100hPa），着力于解决酸沉降的问题。随着近数十年的发展，EMEP/MSC-W模型发生了许多改变，

\subsection{WRF气象驱动设置}

本研究采用WRF气象模式提供精细化的EMEP模式气象驱动场。WRF模式由FNL全球在分析数据驱动，其网格设置如图\ref{wangge}所示。模拟采用四重Domain，中心点设置在珠三角(23.5°N，113.7°E)，采用LAMBERT投影方式。模拟试验采用的物理参数化方案如表\ref{physicsschemes}所示。

\subsection{EMEP模式机制设置}
%EMEP的设置为2个case，其中case：simWithoutCB是由WRF-d04结果直接驱动EMEP模拟，case：simWithCB是由WRF-d01驱动EMEP生产出化学边界（ChemBoundary）之后nested到d04的EMEP模型结果。
